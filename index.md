Small, focused Unity tools that solve one problem well.

QTools is a growing collection of lightweight Unity Asset Store packages built for rapid prototyping, technical art, and production-ready workflows.  
Each tool is intentionally narrow in scope. No bloat. No frameworks. Just useful building blocks.

## Philosophy

- One tool, one job  
- Minimal setup, predictable behaviour  
- Designed for technical artists and developers  
- Works with Unity, not against it  

If you need a grid, you get a grid.  
If you need a dissolve, you get a dissolve.

## Tool Suite

Each QTool is documented independently.

- QDissolve  
- QGrid  
- QOutline  
- More coming as they’re built

Use the navigation on the left to jump to a specific tool.

## Who this is for

- Unity developers who want fast, reusable solutions  
- Technical artists who value control and clarity  
- Prototyping-heavy workflows  
- Teams who dislike feature creep
